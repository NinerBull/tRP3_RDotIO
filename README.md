# R.IO Info in TRP3 Tooltips

For Roleplayers who also like to do PVE, this addon allows Raider.IO information such as M+ Score and Raid Progress to be shown in Total RP 3's Tooltips.
It lays out the info in a neat style so as to not distract from the Character's RP info from the tooltip.

Requires both [Total RP 3](https://github.com/Total-RP/Total-RP-3) and [Raider.IO](https://github.com/RaiderIO/raiderio-addon) to be installed. I am not affiliated with either project.

You can configure the addon in Total RP 3's config window, under 'Settings' > 'Raider.IO'.

-You can toggle showing M+ Score and Raid Progress.
-You can toggle hiding Raider.IO info when you are IC (In Character).
